Yihong questions
- timing of midi changes slightly off? 
- Chord analysis relative to a key?
- check safari and iPad compatibility


- why does timecod ebecome -1 sometimes? Can you log seconds until it happens? - seconds is supposedly 0, -1 only appears on minutes and seconds, not milliseconds 

- keyboard shortucst


- if any other issues with waveform, maybe use HTML canvas vector library https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4340040/html5-canvas-vector-graphics


can you access the individual synths and trigger them? 

- Can you get audio data from youtube or another source? https://github.com/liwa-dev/YTAudioConverterAPI

- Get chroma analysis from Spotify? https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-analysis
- musicpy - https://musicpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction/#introduction


- add keyboard shortcuts (spacebar, esc, arrow keys) 
- what sound should the midi be?
- safari compatibility


Finetuning playback
- waveform is crossing itself at beginning and end

- set up CI/CDf


Typescript cheat sheet:
	onClickHandler: (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => void;

Features
- Select a portion of the waveform to see an average of values
- Playback auto-updates values.
- Data to display:
	- Volume
	- Pitch percentage
- Cool visualization.
	- Shows volume and pitch content using different params.
- Listen to microphone input and react.

Advanced Features
- Can you generate chord progression?
- Can you generate sheet music based on this? 

Issues
- Optimizing visualization of waveform?
- 

- chord analysis on bottom 
	- Find root of the chord: 
- triads: major, minor, dim, aug, sus4, sus2
- sevenths: Major, minor, halfDim, fullDim, dominant
7th, 9th, 11th, 13th
