- auto scroll horizontally with playback
	- there needs to be logic that detects when the seekHandle reaches the end of the current view, no matter where the scroll position is. 
	- can you calculate based on current scroll position and current view width, where is the end of the view area?
	- CALCULATE THE NEXT BREAKPOINT POSITION. IF CUR_POS > NEXT_BREAKPOINT scroll, and update next_breakpoint
	// what if you scroll while audio is playing?
	// reset scroll state when stopping
	// what happens when you pause?
	// shouldn't scroll position be set absolutely instead of incrementally?
	// what if you change window width: while it's playing, while it's paused, while it's stopped
	// are there inconsistentcies with longer audio files?
	// what about when you drag the handle

	// should it be based on 
	


- seek handle drag issue
	- not a matter of speed
	- not a matter of where on the handle you drag
	- not a matter of click, then wait, then drag
	- removing waveform/svg doesn't help
	- making handle bigger doesn't help
	- it works on firefox? 


	
- clean up code after playback features are good 
- test very longer audio

- make draggable highlighted selection that tracks beginning and end timecodes 
- set up CI/CD and testing library when  playback features are set
