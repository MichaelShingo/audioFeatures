- timing of midi changes slightly off? 
- MIDI endpoint 
- Chord data endpoint
- Chord analysis relative to a key? 
- CHECK SAFARI COMPATIBILITY 


const { state, dispatch } = useAppState();

import { useMediaQuery, Theme, useTheme } from '@mui/material';

	const isSmallScreen = useMediaQuery<Theme>((theme) => theme.breakpoints.down('sm'));
	
- check safari and iPad compatibility
- waveform doesn't show on firefox 

- why does timecod ebecome -1 sometimes? Can you log seconds until it happens? 

- keyboard shortucst




can you access the individual synths and trigger them? 

- Can you get audio data from youtube or another source? https://github.com/liwa-dev/YTAudioConverterAPI

- Get chroma analysis from Spotify? https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/reference/get-audio-analysis
- musicpy - https://musicpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Introduction/#introduction


- add keyboard shortcuts (spacebar, esc, arrow keys) 
- what sound should the midi be?
- safari compatibility

- position playhead 
	- what if you have 2 of them? one in waveform, one in midi? 
	- or overlay container?
	- you can't link it to scrolling position because it's terrible without debouncing. 
	- what if you have a separate scrollable container whose scroll is linked to the main container, so you draw on top of it? 
- hitting pause doesn't stop midi current notes

- WaveformSVG.tsx:39 - scroll of waveform container is being set every time waveformScrollPosition, changes. 


Finetuning playback
- waveform is crossing itself at beginning and end

- set up CI/CDf


Typescript cheat sheet:
	onClickHandler: (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLButtonElement>) => void;

Features
- Select a portion of the waveform to see an average of values
- Playback auto-updates values.
- Data to display:
	- Volume
	- Pitch percentage
- Cool visualization.
	- Shows volume and pitch content using different params.
- Listen to microphone input and react.

Advanced Features
- Can you generate chord progression?
- Can you generate sheet music based on this? 

Issues
- Optimizing visualization of waveform?
- 

- chord analysis on bottom 
	- Find root of the chord: 
- triads: major, minor, dim, aug, sus4, sus2
- sevenths: Major, minor, halfDim, fullDim, dominant
7th, 9th, 11th, 13th
